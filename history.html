                            <p>August Horch (12 October 1868 – 3 February 1951) was a German engineer and automobile
                                pioneer, the founder of the manufacturing giant which would eventually become Audi.The
                                first Horch automobile was built in 1901. The company moved to Reichenbach in 1902 and
                                Zwickau in 1904. Horch left the company in 1909 after a dispute, and set up in
                                competition in Zwickau. His new firm was initially called Horch Automobil-Werke GmbH,
                                but following a legal dispute over the Horch name, he decided to make another automobile
                                company. Consequently, Horch named his new company Audi Automobilwerke GmbH in 1910,
                                Audi being
                                the Latinization of Horch.</p>

                                class="content-title">Why does the logo has four rings ?</a>
                            <p>Ever wonder about the meaning behind Audi's four linked rings? Wonder no more, because
                                Audi put together a video explaining the logo's origin story.

                                The four rings represent four different automakers that merged in 1932 to create what
                                was then called the Auto Union. The oldest of these automakers, Horch, was founded in
                                1899 by German engineer August Horch. Soon after, Mr. Horch left his namesake company to
                                form a new automaker, Audi, which also got a ring in the logo. Side note: "Horch" is
                                very close to the German word for "listen;" "Audi" is the Latin translation of the verb.

                                The remaining two companies are Wanderer, which was founded in 1911, and DKW, a
                                steam-engine manufacturer founded in 1916 that began building cars in 1928.After World
                                War II, Auto Union produced cars, motorcycles, and vans, but hit financial and labor
                                problems in the mid-1950s. Auto Union was bought by Daimler-Benz in 1958, encountered
                                more financial troubles, and was sold to Volkswagen in 1964.

                                Shortly after the VW takeover, Auto Union began selling cars under the Audi name. In
                                1969, it acquired another carmaker, NSU. The company then became Audi NSU Auto Union AG,
                                an unwieldy name it went by until 1985, when it was condensed to Audi AG.

                                Union unit</a>
                            <p>A new West German headquartered Auto Union was launched in Ingolstadt with loans from the
                                Bavarian state government and Marshall Plan aid.The reformed company was launched 3
                                September 1949 and continued DKW's tradition of producing front-wheel drive vehicles
                                with two-stroke engines. This included production of a small but sturdy 125 cc
                                motorcycle and a DKW delivery van, the DKW F89 L at Ingolstadt.In 1958, in response to
                                pressure from Friedrich Flick, then the company's largest single shareholder,
                                Daimler-Benz took an 87% holding in the Auto Union company, and this was increased to a
                                100% holding in 1959. However, small two-stroke cars were not the focus of
                                Daimler-Benz's interests, and while the early 1960s saw major investment in new Mercedes
                                models and in a state of the art factory for Auto Union's, the company's aging model
                                range at this time did not benefit from the economic boom of the early 1960s to the same
                                extent as competitor manufacturers such as Volkswagen and Opel. The decision to dispose
                                of the Auto Union business was based on its lack of profitability. Ironically, by
                                the time they sold the business, it also included a large new factory and near
                                production-ready modern four-stroke engine, which would enable the Auto Union business,
                                under a new owner, to embark on a period of profitable growth, now producing not Auto
                                Unions or DKWs, but using the "Audi" name, resurrected in 1965 after a 25-year gap.In
                                1964, Volkswagen acquired a 50% holding in the business, which included the new factory
                                in Ingolstadt, the DKW and Audi brands along with the rights to the new engine design
                                which had been funded by Daimler-Benz, who in return retained the dormant Horch
                                trademark and the Düsseldorf factory which became a Mercedes-Benz van assembly plant.
                                DKW brand because of its associations with two-stroke
                                technology, and having classified the model internally as the F103, sold it simply as
                                the "Audi". Later developments of the model were named after their horsepower ratings
                                and sold as the Audi 60, 75, 80, and Super 90, selling until 1972. Initially, Volkswagen
                                was hostile to the idea of Auto Union as a standalone entity producing its own models
                                having acquired the company merely to boost its own production capacity through the
                                Ingolstadt assembly plant – to the point where Volkswagen executives ordered that the
                                Auto Union name and flags bearing the four rings were removed from the factory
                                buildings. Then VW chief Heinz Nordhoff explicitly forbade Auto Union from any further
                                product development.In the 1950s, NSU had been the world's largest
                                manufacturer of motorcycles, but had moved on to produce small cars like the NSU Prinz,
                                the TT and TTS versions of which are still popular as vintage race cars.The Neckarsulm
                                plant is now used to produce the larger Audi models
                                A6 and A8. The Neckarsulm factory is also home of the "quattro GmbH" (from November 2016
                                "Audi Sport GmbH"), a subsidiary responsible for development and production of Audi
                                high-performance models: the R8 and the RS model range.</p>

                                Era</a>
                            <p>In 1985, with the Auto Union and NSU brands effectively dead, the company's official name
                                was now shortened to simply Audi AG.In 1986, as the Passat-based Audi 80 was beginning
                                to develop a kind of "grandfather's car" image, the type 89 was introduced. This
                                completely new development sold extremely well. However, its modern and dynamic exterior
                                belied the low performance of its base engine, and its base package was quite spartan.
                                In 1987, Audi put forward a new and very
                                elegant Audi 90, which had a much superior set of standard features. In the early 1990s,
                                sales began to slump for the Audi 80 series, and some basic construction problems
                                started to surface.

                                In the early part of the 21st century, Audi set forth on a German racetrack to claim and
                                maintain several world records, such as top speed endurance.Through the early 1990s,
                                Audi began to shift its target market upscale to compete against German automakers
                                Mercedes-Benz and BMW. This began with the release of the Audi V8 in 1990. It was
                                essentially a new engine fitted to the Audi 100/200, but with noticeable bodywork
                                differences. Most obvious was the new grille that was now incorporated in the bonnet.

                                By 1991, Audi had the four-cylinder Audi 80, the 5-cylinder Audi 90 and Audi 100, the
                                turbocharged Audi 200 and the Audi V8. There was also a coupé version of the 80/90 with
                                both four- and five-cylinder engines.</p>

                                <p> In November 2015, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency implicated the 3-liter
                                    diesel
                                    engine versions of the 2016 Audi A6 Quattro, A7 Quattro, A8, A8L and the Q5 as
                                    further
                                    models that had emissions regulation defeat-device software installed. Thus, these
                                    models emitted nitrogen oxide at up to nine times the legal limit when the car
                                    detected
                                    that it was not hooked up to emissions testing equipment.

                                    In November 2016, Audi expressed an intention to establish an assembly factory in
                                    Pakistan, with the company's local partner acquiring land for a plant in Korangi
                                    Creek
                                    Industrial Park in Karachi. Approval of the plan would lead to an investment of $30
                                    million in the new plant.[52] Audi planned to cut 9,500 jobs in Germany starting
                                    from
                                    2020 till 2025 to fund electric vehicles and digital working.

                                    In February 2020, Volkswagen AG announced that it plans to take over all Audi shares
                                    it
                                    does not own (totalling 0.36%) via a squeeze-out according to German stock
                                    corporation
                                    law, thus making Audi a fully owned subsidiary of the Volkswagen Group. This change
                                    took effect from 16 November 2020, when Audi became a wholly owned subsidiary of the
                                    Volkswagen Group.

                                    In January 2021, Audi announced that it is planning to sell 1 million vehicles in
                                    China
                                    in 2023, comparing to 726,000 vehicles in 2020.</p>
