                        <div>
                            <p>Audi assists drivers with a broad range of assistance systems, from the turn and parking
                                assistants to the camera-based road sign recognition. They deliver more safety,
                                convenience, and efficiency, and they pave the way for piloted driving. If you are
                                looking to purchase an Audi vehicle and you are looking for more information about the
                                safety features of the vehicle, then you have come to the right place at Pfaff Audi in
                                Vaughan, ON. In this article by Pfaff Audi, we share some information about the Audi
                                Driver Assitance System.

                        <div class="Turn-Assist">
                            <p>Turn assist monitors the road lane with oncoming traffic by means of radar sensors, the
                                front
                                camera, and, in certain models, a laser scanner. Monitoring is initiated as soon as the
                                driver sets the turn signal. When driving off from a stop, or during slow driving up to
                                a
                                speed of 10 km/h, the system can intervene by applying the brakes to prevent the car
                                from
                                colliding with an oncoming vehicle when turning left or right. This brake intervention
                                keeps
                                the vehicle within its own driving lane. The driver is informed of the intervention by
                                an
                                indicator in the instrument cluster.

                            <p>Adaptive cruise control offers relief to drivers especially on long trips and in
                                stop-and-go traffic. It maintains a preset distance to the vehicle ahead by
                                automatically accelerating and braking. The driver can choose from five distance levels
                                and adjust acceleration and control system dynamics with Audi drive select. The system
                                uses radar sensors and a front camera. They detect vehicles ahead and measure the
                                distance to them. In interplay with S tronic or Tiptronic, the system covers the entire
                                speed range from 0 to 250 km/h. With a manual transmission, it starts at 30 km/h. When
                                the system is deactivated, the distance indicator shows the distance to the car ahead
                                and warns drivers when they are tailgating.

                        <h2>Active Lane Assist</h2>
                        <p>Operating at speeds from 65 km/h, Audi active lane assist helps the driver keep the vehicle
                            in the driving lane. A camera detects lane lines and the track that the car is following
                            between them. In this process, the camera can distinguish between yellow lines in
                            construction zones and standard white markings. If the car approaches a line without the
                            turn signal being activated, the system helps the driver to steer back into the lane by
                            means of gentle but noticeable interventions in the electromechanical power steering. In the
                            MMI system, the driver sets how early the control intervention should occur. In the case of
                            an early steering intervention point, the system guides the driver towards the middle of the
                            lane by gentle, centering steering interventions.
                        </p>

                        <p>The Audi pre sense 360Ëš detects collision hazards all around the car and initiates specific
                            safety measures. It includes the following driver assistant systems: Audi pre sense front,
                            side, rear, and basic.

                            There are several other features that make up the Audi Driver Assistance System. If you are
                            looking for more in-depth information about this, we encourage you to get in touch with a
